Notes on Writing
----------------

*  We don't plan on including code in this paper, but if you think you will need
   to include code in your section, please add it to a separate python module
   (.py file) and include it in this repository.
*  Use `\sectionname` not ``Section``, `\figurename` not ``Figure``,
   `\equationname` not ``Equation``etc.
*  Use `\astropypkg` for the astropy package, `\astropy` for the astropy
   project, `\python` not ``Python``
