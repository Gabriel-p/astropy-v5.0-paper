Notes on writing
----------------

*  We don't plan on including code in this paper, but if you think you will need
   to include code in your section, please add it to a separate python module
   (.py file) and include it in this repository.
*  Use `\sectionname` not ``Section``, `\figurename` not ``Figure``,
   `\equationname` not ``Equation``etc.
*  Use `\astropypkg` for the astropy package, `\astropy` for the astropy
   project, `\python` not ``Python``
<!-- *  If your subpackage was included in Paper I, then please just include a
   note on what the package does, a reference to paper I, and any new major
   updates to your package
*  If your subpackage was not included, then please describe the
   subpackage on level with what was in the first paper, and highlight any
   major features in it. Typical length should be equivalent to one page
